# Generic-Recommendor-System

The increasing importance of the Web as a medium for electronic and business transactions has served as a driving force for the development of recommender systems technology. Recommender System helps business to increase their sales through cross-selling and advertisements. It discovers information about the items that are likely to be of interest to the users. More than 35% of product sales come from recommendations in Amazon.com, 66% of movies rented in Netflix are recommended ones, 38% more click-throughs are generated from recommendations in Google News. 

All these statistics tell about the importance of recommender system in the present day both from the perspective of end-user and industries running an online business.

In this project I have tried to implement the concept of generic recommender systems.
